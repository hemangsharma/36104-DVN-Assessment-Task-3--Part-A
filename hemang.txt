Research Questions:

1. Property Type and Price: Does the type of property (apartment, house) significantly affect the price? 
We'll compare these types statistically and visually to see if there's a price difference.

2. Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Price: How do the number of bedrooms and bathrooms influence pricing? We'll analyze the relationships using correlation and visualize them to see how these features impact price. 

3. Square Footage and Price: Is there a connection between a property's size (square footage) and its price? We'll calculate correlations and use scatter plots to explore this relationship. We might even analyze it separately for apartments and houses.

4. Location and Price: Does where a property is located in NYC (borough, neighborhood) affect its price? We'll use mapping and spatial analysis techniques to see how prices are distributed across different areas. We'll also use statistical tests to measure the impact of location on pricing.
